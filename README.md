## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a **software engineer** who believes in solving problems first, choosing technology second. My work focuses on **real-time systems, secure authentication, and scalable backend architectures** — with a strong emphasis on **user experience** and **system design thinking**.

💡 **What drives me:**  
Understanding constraints, designing elegant solutions, and shipping products that matter.

🎯 **Currently:** Building production-ready applications | Seeking internship opportunities | Exploring AI-powered development workflows

---

## 🏗️ My Engineering Philosophy

```javascript
const approach = {
  step1: "Understand the problem deeply",
  step2: "Map constraints & requirements", 
  step3: "Design the system architecture",
  step4: "Choose the right tech stack",
  step5: "Build, iterate, ship"
};

// Technology serves the solution, not the other way around.
```

### 🔐 Passkey Authentication System
**The Problem:** Passwords are weak, vulnerable, and frustrating for users.

**My Solution:**
- Implemented **WebAuthn/FIDO2** passwordless authentication
- Built complete **registration and authentication flows** with biometric support
- Designed **fallback mechanisms** for cross-platform compatibility
- Created secure **credential storage** with encryption best practices

**Tech:** Node.js, Express, WebAuthn API, MongoDB  
**Impact:** 100% phishing-resistant authentication with zero password management
