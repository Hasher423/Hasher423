## 🧠 Engineering Mindset
```
Problem first.
Constraints second.
Technology last.
```

I focus on **problem-solving and system design**, not just writing features.  
My work spans **real-time systems, authentication, scalable backends, and clean UX flows**.

---

## 🛠️ What I’ve Worked On (Past → Present)

- 🔐 **WebAuthn / Passkeys** — passwordless, secure authentication
- 🎥 **WebRTC & MediaSoup** — real-time streaming and low-latency media
- ⚡ **One-click & intent-based UI flows** — reducing friction for users
- 🧠 **Redux Toolkit architecture** — predictable, scalable state]

## 🔍 Problem → Solution Thinking

| Problem | Solution I Built |
|-------|------------------|
| Weak passwords & login friction | Passkey-based authentication |
| Complex user flows | One-click UX patterns |
| Unmanageable app state | Global Redux architecture |
| Generic portfolios | AI-generated, personalized sites |
